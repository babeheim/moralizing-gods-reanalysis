The following code was based on the analyses in: 

> Whitehouse, H., Fran√ßois, P., Savage, P. E., Currie, T. E., Feeney, K. C., Cioni, E., Purcell, R., Ross, R. M., Larson, J., Baines, J., ter Haar, B., Covey, A., Turchin, P. (2019). Complex societies precede moralizing gods throughout world history. Nature.

with data file "exportdat.csv" scraped from the Seshat database on 10 Jan 2018. Steps 1 to 8 are the original analysis code with some minor reorganization, while steps 9 to 12 are extensions and modifications.

- plry (1.8.4)

- glmmTMB (0.2.3)
- nlme (3.1-137)
- lme4 (1.1-21)
- stargazer (5.2.2)
